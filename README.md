# Portfolio-simple-wepsite


This is a simple portfolio website created using HTML and basic CSS.
It includes only two pages:

Home Page – Showcases a short introduction.

Contact Page – Provides a way to get in touch.


The website is designed with a clean and minimal layout, focusing on simplicity and basic web structure.

Would you like me to also make it in a ready-to-copy README format with sections like Features, Technologies Used, and How to View?
